- **Real-time Notifications**: May require additional infrastructure
- **Recipe Import Feature**: Dependent on third-party website structures
- **Mobile App**: Requires additional expertise and development time

### Medium Risk Items
- **Search Performance**: May require search engine integration (Elasticsearch)
- **Image Upload/Storage**: Storage costs and performance considerations
- **Nutritional Data**: API costs and data accuracy concerns

## Next Steps & Decisions Needed

### Immediate Decisions (This Week)

2. **Project Structure**: Finalize directory organization
3. **Development Environment Setup**: Local development configuration

### Short-term Planning (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Database Schema Finalization**: Complete entity relationship design
2. **API Design**: Define all backend endpoints
3. **UI Mockups**: Create basic wireframes and designs

### Medium-term Planning (Next Month)
1. **MVP Feature Set**: Prioritize core features for first release
2. **Deployment Strategy**: Choose hosting and deployment approach
3. **Testing Strategy**: Define testing frameworks and coverage goals

## Notes & Considerations
